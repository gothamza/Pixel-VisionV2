# üöÄ health care chatbot in criticale cases
We are building a chat bot in medical care, but we add a system prompt so that it only answers the user in first aid when he uses an image to chat with it, and we use the base model Lava Med when he wants to share his information about health care in general. we were aiming to add stable diffusion model to show how to do eatche step to take care of the injery, but the results was bad, and tavily API to provide resources and nllb to translate, but we didnt manage to implement that in time.

we add an option for the user to save the chat localy as csv
